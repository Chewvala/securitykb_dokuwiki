~~NOTOC~~
======= Dokuwiki Pentest Notes Layout ======
This preconfigured instance of DokuWiki was made to help pentesters perform complete and well-documented pentests. Because DokuWiki doesn't require a database, the entire web root can be stored in a [[http://www.truecrypt.org/|truecrypt]] container to help keep engagement information safe.

The sidebar on the left is broken up into three different categories, notes, tasks, and knowledge base (kb). The framework makes use of DokuWikiâ€™s [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/namespaces|namespaces]] feature to keep everything organized. The following table provides anoverview of the framework's built in layout:

^  Notes                                ^^
| [[notes:pre-engagement]]     | Pre-engagement research is critical to engagement success. Use this area to keep track of what you find before the engagement phase starts.|
| [[notes:network_wide_actions]]        | Sometimes it can be to much work to document every action taken against each host on it's own page (e.g. nmap scans). Use this page to document network wide actions|
| [[notes:target_notes]]                | This page should act as the core of engagement notes. Keep a high level list of all hosts, captured credentials, and gathered loot here. Use the tables on this page to help prioritize targets.|
| Namespace: [[notes:targets:hosts:]]   | Every system that is reviewed should get it's own hosts page (Pages in the host namespace have a default template. [[notes:targets:hosts:example|Click here]] and then create the page to see an example). Keep a record of all actions performed on and against host based targets.|
| Namespace: [[notes:targets:persons:]] | This namespace acts as the who's who for the engagement. Every targeted, high-value user (e.g. domain admins, business executives, etc...) should get his or her own page.|
| [[notes:other]]                       | Use this place as a scratch pad for the one-off notes that don't fit anywhere else.|
^  Tasks                                ^^
| [[tasks:pre-engagement]]              | High level checklist for critical steps in pre-engagement phase of the test|
| [[tasks:engagement]]                  | High level checklist for critical steps in engagement phase of the test|
| [[tasks:post-engagement]]             | High level checklist for critical steps in post-engagement phase of the test|
^  Knowledge Base (KB)                  ^^
| Namespace: [[kb:]]                    | This section is coming soon. Eventually, this namespace will act as a set of local cheat sheets for common tools, tactics, and techniques.|
